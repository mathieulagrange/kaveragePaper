\section{Answer to Reviewer II}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{My concern still is the convergence in the general case, i.e., for arbitrary similarity measures. I still do not see how Sections 3.3 and 3.4 provide guarantees that the algorithms will converge. Can there be a similarity measure such that the k-average method does not oscillate and will always lead to a local maximum.\\
It does not seem to be obvious in the general case, therefore a formal proof would be an invaluable addition to the clarity of the paper.}

$\rightarrow$ A new section (Section 5 in the manuscript) is added to the manuscript specifically dedicated to the proof of convergence for the k-averages algorithm. We made our best to have the key points rooting the convergence more explicit.
